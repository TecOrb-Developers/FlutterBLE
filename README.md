# FlutterBLE
### Connect bluetooth device to android/ios phone with Flutter app

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

FLutterBLE is an app built using flutter framework to connect any Bluetooth Low Energy device with your android or ios phone and perform operations on it.

## Features
- FlutterBlusPlus plugin used
- Search for bluetooth devices
- Connect to bluetooth device
- Get all services provided by the device
- Read/Write operations using UUIDs
- Listen to notifications given by the device using streams



## HOW IT WORKS

There is some setup required to work with bluetooth in Flutter application. To start with, add flutter_blue_plus plugin in pubspec.yaml file and do the following for android and ios setups respectively.

### Android Setup
1. Change the minSdkVersion for Android in android/app/build.gradle:
```
Android {
  defaultConfig {
     minSdkVersion: 19
```

2. Add this in android manifest.xml file
```
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />  
	 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />  
	 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
	 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION"/>

     <!-- For Android 12+ support-->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
```

### IOS Setup
In the ios/Runner/Info.plist letâ€™s add:
```
<dict>  
	    <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>  
	    <string>Need BLE permission</string>  
	    <key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>  
	    <string>Need BLE permission</string>  
	    <key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>  
	    <string>Need Location permission</string>  
	    <key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>  
	    <string>Need Location permission</string>  
	    <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>  
	    <string>Need Location permission</string>
```

## Let's breakdown into code now:

1. Get an instance for flutter blue plus.
```
FlutterBluePlus flutterBlue = FlutterBluePlus.instance;
```
2. Start scanning for devices and listen to results
```
// Start scanning
flutterBlue.startScan(timeout: Duration(seconds: 4));

// Listen to scan results
var subscription = flutterBlue.scanResults.listen((results) {
    // do something with scan results
    for (ScanResult r in results) {
        print('${r.device.name} found! rssi: ${r.rssi}');
    }
});

// Stop scanning
flutterBlue.stopScan();
```
3. Connect/Disconnect to a device
```
// Connect to the device
await device.connect();

// Disconnect from device
device.disconnect();
```
4. Discover for services provided by bluetooth device
```
List<BluetoothService> services = await device.discoverServices();
services.forEach((service) {
    // do something with service
});
```
5. After getting all services get characteristics and descriptors. And with perform operations on ble device with unique UUIDs.
```
// Reads all characteristics
var characteristics = service.characteristics;
for(BluetoothCharacteristic c in characteristics) {
    List<int> value = await c.read();
    print(value);
}

// Writes to a characteristic
await c.write([0x12, 0x34])


// Reads all descriptors
var descriptors = characteristic.descriptors;
for(BluetoothDescriptor d in descriptors) {
    List<int> value = await d.read();
    print(value);
}

// Writes to a descriptor
await d.write([0x12, 0x34])
```

6. Also subscribe to notifications emitted by the ble device.
```
await characteristic.setNotifyValue(true);
characteristic.value.listen((value) {
    // do something with new value
});
```
7. Read the MTU and request larger size
```
final mtu = await device.mtu.first;
await device.requestMtu(512);
```
